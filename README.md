# SwiftGumbo

A Swift wrapper and CSS like query library for the [gumbo-parser](https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser) HTML library. Query selection functionality is a Swift port of [lazytiger/gumbo-query](https://github.com/lazytiger/gumbo-query). See `SwiftGumboTests.swift` for supported selectors.

Source for gumbo-parser is the [lua-gumbo](https://github.com/craigbarnes/lua-gumbo) fork which contains several [bug fixes](https://github.com/craigbarnes/lua-gumbo/tree/0344e17eb0811583480151648ed307f79a8a38ac/lib).
